### **Project Title:**

**Building a Recommendation System Using Java and Apache Mahout to Suggest Products or Content Based on User Preferences**

### **Project Description:**

In today's digital age, recommendation systems have become an essential feature of e-commerce platforms, streaming services, and content-driven websites. This project aims to design and implement a **Recommendation System** using **Java** and the **Apache Mahout** machine learning library to provide personalized product or content suggestions based on user preferences.

The system follows a **collaborative filtering approach**, which leverages user-item interaction data to generate relevant recommendations. The backend of the application is developed using **Java in IntelliJ IDEA**, ensuring strong object-oriented design, modularity, and efficient data handling. The **Apache Mahout** library, known for its scalable machine learning algorithms, plays a central role in building and training the recommendation engine.

The recommendation model is built upon a **user-based filtering algorithm**, which identifies users with similar preferences and suggests items liked by those users. The system processes a dataset that includes sample users, items, and user ratings or interactions. Using this information, it calculates similarity scores between users and predicts how likely a user is to prefer an unseen item.

For demonstration purposes, a **sample dataset** has been created with user IDs, item IDs (products or content), and rating values. The recommendation logic, built with Mahout’s `GenericUserBasedRecommender`, uses `PearsonCorrelationSimilarity` or `EuclideanDistanceSimilarity` to compute user similarity. The final output of the engine is a ranked list of suggested items for each user.

On the **frontend**, a responsive and user-friendly interface is built using **HTML, CSS, and JavaScript** in **Visual Studio Code (VS Code)**. The frontend enables users to:

* View available products or content,
* Submit or simulate rating data, and
* Receive personalized recommendations.

The backend and frontend communicate through **RESTful APIs**, allowing smooth data exchange and real-time interaction. When a user requests recommendations, the frontend sends the user ID to the backend, which then invokes Mahout’s recommendation engine and returns a list of suggested items, displayed dynamically in the UI.

Key Features:

* User-based collaborative filtering.
* RESTful API integration between backend (Java) and frontend (JavaScript).
* Clean, minimal frontend for interaction.
* Customizable sample dataset for testing and evaluation.
* Scalable architecture to support larger datasets with minimal modification.

This project demonstrates how recommendation systems can enhance user engagement and experience by delivering targeted suggestions. It provides an excellent foundation for further development, including item-based filtering, hybrid models, or integration with larger platforms. Apache Mahout’s flexibility allows for the future integration of clustering and classification algorithms as well.

In conclusion, this Java-based recommendation engine using Apache Mahout showcases how machine learning techniques can be effectively implemented in real-world applications. It offers a practical example for developers interested in data science, personalization engines, and full-stack application design.
